### 0.2.3 Lint This

The fine folks created a linter, so it is good to use one.

### 0.2.2 The Burned Version

CI killed the version number, really I think it would be my fault.

### 0.2.1 Project Discovery

Enable fetching from the Blynk application to configure accessories.  For a device the parameter `discover` was added to let the Platform know if it should discover available devices are read the configuration file.  If `{ "discover": true }` is found then the `accessories` are ignored if defined.  If there is a change in settings from `discover` being set to false from true, the accessoriesCache will need to be manually updated to avoid item duplication.

Addition of config.schema.json to allow for easier configuration through homebridge-config-ui-x.

### 0.2.0 Breakin' Configs

Inlude a way to update the HomeKit if the switch state is changed with the Blynk application.

Format the configuration to allow an application to have multiple attached devices.  Each attached device can be configured with multiple functions, provided each function is a switch.

### 0.1.0 Get it runnin'

Initial release with limited device support, only for switches.  Supports only a single device attached to the Blynk application but can have multiple functions on the single device.
